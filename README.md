# Vaccine Response Simulation (Python)

This repository simulates a clinical trial-like scenario to evaluate the effectiveness of different vaccine dosing regimens: single-dose, two-dose, and booster shots. It demonstrates how data scientists can simulate biologically realistic datasets, apply appropriate statistical tests, and communicate insights to guide decision-making in public health or pharmaceutical settings.

## Project Highlights

- 📊 Simulates demographic and clinical variables (age, sex, BMI, comorbidities).
- 🧪 Models antibody titers over time for various dosing groups.
- ✅ Performs OLS regression, ANOVA, and logistic regression to compare immunological responses.
- 📈 Includes rich visualizations: boxplots, line charts, and scatter plots.
- 🔍 Identifies top 10% responders and interprets real-world implications.
- 📁 Delivered in a clean and reproducible Jupyter Notebook format.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/lukahere007/Vaccine-Simulation-Python.git
   cd Vaccine-Simulation-Python
   ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
